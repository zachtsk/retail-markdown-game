## Overview

If you knew nothing about a product other than the unit cost, how would you approach finding the optimal price?

This simulation is designed to demonstrate the price discovery process in a simple a retail context.

Each round, you can set a price that 50 potential buyers will evaluate. The probability that any individual will buy the product at the set price is determined using a randomized log linear price curve.
